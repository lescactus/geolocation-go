# geolocation-go

This repository contains a simple geolocation api microservice, fast, reliable, Kubernetes friendly and ready written in go as a proof of concept.

## Motivations

Study the feasibility of having a geolocation REST API microservice running alongside our other microservices in Kubernetes to avoid relying on the `Cloudfront-Viewer-Country` http headers.
The requirements are:

* Reliability
* Fast
* Concurrent

## Design

`geolocation-go` is written in Go, a fery fast and performant garbaged collected and concurrent programming language.

It expose a simple `GET /rest/v1/{ip}` REST endpoint.

Parameter: 

* `/rest/v1/{ip}` (string) - IPv4 

Response:

* `{"ip":"88.74.7.1","country_code":"DE","country_name":"Germany","city":"DÃ¼sseldorf","latitude":51.2217,"longitude":6.77616}`

To retrieve the country code and country name of the given IP address, `geolocation-go` use the [ip-api.com](https://ip-api.com/) real-time Geolocation API, and then cache it in-memory and in Redis for later fast retrievals.

```

1) Client make an HTTP request to `/rest/v1/{ip}`

2) `geolocation-go` will lookup for in his in-memory datastore and send the response if cache HIT. In case of cache MISS, go to step 3)

3) `geolocation-go` will lookup in Redis, send the response if cache HIT and add the response in his in-memory datastore asynchronously. In case of cache MISS, go to step 4)

4) `geolocation-go` will make an HTTP call to the [ip-api.com](https://ip-api.com/docs/api:json) API, send back the response to the client and add the response to Redis and the in-memory datastore asynchronously.
